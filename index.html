              The first time I ever made a website, it was for my 7th grade
              media class. The website was a very basic 3 page site on my cat,
              but I had the best time creating it. Later, in my sophomore year
              of highschool, I was able to take Web Fundamentals I through
              SWIC's dual-credit program, and this class changed my life. I had
              fallen in love with making websites, and I decided to become a web
              developer. That class is also why I am going to SWIC now, and I
              took more dual-credit classes throughout highschool, which only
              heightened my excitement to learn web development.

            <p>In my free time, I love to play video games and listen to music. I have a pretty decent collection of Lego's I've built that I love to display on my shelves with my albums, books, and video games. I like to paint and draw, primarily of people and animals, with watercolor and gouache. I also do a lot of photography, with scenery and people.</p>
