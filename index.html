            <p>
              The first time I ever made a website, it was for my 7th grade
              media class. The website was a very basic 3 page site on my cat,
              but I had the best time creating it. Later, in my sophomore year
              of highschool, I was able to take Web Fundamentals I through
              SWIC's dual-credit program, and this class changed my life. I had
              fallen in love with making websites, and I decided to become a web
              developer. That class is also why I am going to SWIC now, and I
              took more dual-credit classes throughout highschool, which only
              heightened my excitement to learn web development.
